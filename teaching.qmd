I teach research methods courses in political science at LSE and the LSE Summer School and have previously taught at Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. These courses mostly cover both quantitative approaches to studying politics, from experimental design and causal inference to comparative methods and research ethics. I enjoy helping students develop the skills to ask important questions and answer them through rigorous research.
